# ========================================================
# Design Rationale: Line Ending Normalization
#
# This repository enforces LF line endings for all markdown
# and plaintext files to ensure cross-platform consistency.
# Developers on Windows, macOS, and Linux may use different
# editors and Git configurations â€” without this rule, diffs
# and file parsing may behave unpredictably.
#
# Benefits:
# - Prevents noisy Git diffs caused by CRLF/CR variations
# - Ensures markdown formatting renders consistently
# - Aligns with Unix-style tooling and automation
# ========================================================

# Normalize line endings across platforms
